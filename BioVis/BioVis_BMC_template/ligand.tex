\parttitle{Background} Protein structures and their interaction with ligands have been in the focus of biochemistry and structural biology

\section*{Background}
TODO BK + JP (Intro + RW)

The study of reaction processes between different types of molecules has been an important research problem already for decades.
A proper understanding of the processes occurring when two or more molecules react helps in the design of new chemical matters, e.g., in drug design or protein engineering.
Here, the researchers aim to combine a protein with a given ligand in order to design a new drug or to change protein properties and their function.
In these particular cases the ligand has to be transported from the outer solvent to the protein active site where the chemical reaction between the ligand and the amino acids surrounding the active site takes place.
The consecutive reaction then changes the composition and properties of both molecules. 
In protein engineering, for example, the goal is to alter the protein properties so that the new protein is, e.g., more stable and resistant to organic cosolvents~\cite{Koudelakova2013}.

The design complexity of such reactions lies namely in the transportation of the ligand to the protein active site.
As the active site is usually buried deeply in the protein structure and thus inaccessible directly from its surface, the ligand has to find a suitable transportation path through the protein structure.
This process, called molecular docking, is very complex, lengthy, and its analysis is heavy on computational resources. 
Therefore, researchers aim at solutions that simplify and ease the analysis for proper ligand binding.
Currently available solutions often focus on detection of possible ligand transportation paths through the protein, called tunnels.
These solutions are mostly based on the geometric analysis, which lead to the tunnel detection in the end, e.g., CAVER~\cite{Chovancova2012}, MOLE~\cite{Sehnal2013}, or MolAxis~\cite{Yaffe2008}.
Other approaches, such as MoMA-LigPath~\cite{Devaurs}, aim at simulating the ligand transportation itself.
Nevertheless, simulating the ligand docking using current computational approaches is still a challenging problem.
There are several available variants of molecular simulation methods devised specifically to this problem. 
Among these Steered Molecular Dynamics~\cite{Isralewitz} and Random Acceleration Molecular Dynamics~\cite{Ludemann} are able to simulate the ligand binding. 
Such simulations produce a large amount of data containing the ligand movements that are to be explored by the domain expert.
As the length of these simulations reaches often hundreds of thousands of time steps, it becomes impossible for the domain experts to visualize and observe the ligand movement in a frame-by-frame manner.
Moreover, the simulation often contains movements that are irrelevant to the ligand binding.
For example, a significant portion of the simulation the ligand usually spends outside the protein searching for a proper tunnel gorge to enter the molecule. 
It also often happens that the ligand enters the molecule via a wrong tunnel and is then evicted from the molecule and searches for the entrance repeatedly.
Therefore, the "true" active site entering can be in fact captured in a smaller subset of the original sequence.

In this paper, we propose a new visual analysis system that addresses the aforementioned challenges, i.e.,  the transportation of a ligand to the active site. 
We aim to provide the domain experts with a tool for intuitive and interactive exploration of already captured molecular dynamics simulation containing the process of ligand binding. 
Using our proposed solution the users are able to distinguish between the parts of the simulation where the ligand searches for the proper path to the active site (searches the tunnel gorge or enters the wrong tunnel) and the part where the ligand finally leads to and reaches the active site.

{\color{red} CHANGE
We introduce a dedicated method for simplification of the original trajectory.
The method can simplify the ligand path hierarchically, thus providing several levels of detail (LOD), which can be interactively examined.
\textbf{In the most abstracted view, represented as the top-most LOD, the temporal tunnel shows only the significant shifts of the ligand towards the active site. 
Here, the user can interactively brush time intervals, which automatically reveals and adopts the temporal tunnel to the selected interval.}
This abstracted representation, providing the brushing capabilities, is interactively linked with the 3D visualization where the 3D shape of the temporal tunnel for the given temporal window is displayed.
Further, our tool enables to explore the amino acids surrounding the ligand along its path to the active site as well.

Our proposed solution was thoroughly tested and evaluated by the domain experts from protein engineering.
They performed the evaluation on their own simulations and their feedback is described in....}

\section{Related Work}
The interactive exploration of ligand paths through protein structures is a complex problem that requires an elaborate analysis of existing and convenient approaches.
As our system addresses several areas, this section will be divided with respect to these areas as well. 
Studying the ligand transport path is tightly related to the analysis of its trajectory.
Thus, the first part will cover the topic related to the trajectory analysis, simplification, and visualization.
Then the existing representations of tunnels and their surrounding amino acids will be addressed.

\subsection*{Trajectory Analysis, Simplification, and Visualization}
When searching for the most appropriate trajectory simplification method, the taxonomy of different movement patterns introduced by Dodge et al.~\cite{Dodge2008} can help to categorize the type of motion and to propose an appropriate solution for the analysis and simplification.
Then, Andrienko et al.~\cite{andrienko2013} describe a legacy of tools and approaches to analyze trajectory data.
With respect to the trajectory simplification, they introduce two approaches to data abstraction representing a necessary step to achieve the reduction of the data in order to achieve informative visualizations.
The first approach is characterized by omitting unnecessary positions and segments, while the second exploits data subsampling.
On the other hand, they state that there is no general method to sample trajectories.
Thus the suitability of particular sampling method is deduced from what information is considered important.
A recent work of Vrotsou et al.~\cite{Vrotsou2015} introduce a systematic stepwise methodology for trajectory simplification with emphasis on visual analysis.
Even though they primarily developed the tool to analyze three dimensional trajectories, it is not limited to them only.

In the field of molecular biology as well as systems biology, there are several examples of methods focusing on trajectory analysis.
Bidmon et al.~\cite{bidmon2008} present an abstract way of identification and visualization of solvent molecules' pathways within molecular dynamics. 
In comparison to previous solutions, their approach preserves valuable information on the directions and velocities of water molecules routing along these paths. 
Another approach that describes a guidance through a complex simulation trajectories in systems biology is presented by Luboschik et al.~\cite{Luboschik2012}. 
The method addresses biochemical reaction networks and aims to provide the users with a tool for investigating the overall behavior of a modeled system and detailed behavior at the same time.

\subsection{Visualization of Cavity and Tunnel Features}
Phillips et al.~\cite{phillips2010} propose a method to quantitatively estimate molecular features, e.g., volume and surface areas, via ray-casting technique. This involves computation of cavities.
Lindow et al.~\cite{LindowBH11} introduce a technique that allows to extract significant paths from the molecules. 
In their approach the authors utilize Voronoi diagram of spheres. 
Their final visualization is achieved by means of placing light sources on the extracted paths to enhance the presence of tunnels.
Parulek et al.~\cite{parulek2012} exploit scatterplots to communicate the evolution of protein voids. 
In their later study~\cite{parulek2013} they also suggest to utilize amino acids physico-chemical properties related to cavities to help users to navigate through their occurrences. 
The visualization is then achieved in the focus and context manner.
Lindow et al. \cite{Lindow2013} present an approach for visualization of temporal evolution of cavities in a temporal graph, which, to a certain extent, resembles our temporal tunnel model. 
In this work they focus on the interactive exploration of the dynamics of protein cavities that can form the transportation path for a ligand. 
They calculate and visualize the cavity volume and analyze the time-dependent changes of the cavity structure.
The cavity dynamics is captured by rendering the cavities in a single image. 
The final visualization is achieved through the molecular surface representation colored according to time. 
Krone et al.~\cite{krone2013features} present a similar approach, where they extract and track tunnels in MD simulations. They exploit temporal graphs to communicate the evolution of surface areas of tunnels. In our technique, we go one step further, where in addition, we incorporate the ligand-protein interaction information and provide users with the means to navigate through details of this interaction. Moreover, we analyze sequences of several thousands of frames, which is not the case in aforementioned approaches.
Kozlikova et al.~\cite{kozlikova2014vcbm} propose a way to seamlessly visualize the geometry and shape of tunnels across MD simulation. Here, they aim at 3D visualization solely, which is not suitable way of exploring and understanding of thousands of simulation time-steps.
Byska et al.~\cite{byska2016} introduce an approach to interactively explore the tunnel objects in MD simulations. Similarly to our approach they visualize the time-varying tunnel as a profile graph that includes information on surrounding amino acids. Nevertheless, they focus on a single tunnel instance and do not provide the means to explore the ligand-protein interaction.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Problem Description and Input Data}
When studying long molecular dynamics simulations, the researchers have to face namely the following high-level tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect the part of the simulation where the ligand enters the protein and finally reaches the active site.
\item Explore this route in detail and detect its bottlenecks.
\end{itemize}
In consequence, these steps are performed in order to reveal the parts of the trajectory where the ligand gets stuck.
It means that in such parts there are some obstacles made by the surrounding amino acids.
These obstacles can be geometric (the empty space between these amino acids is too narrow) or physico-chemical (the properties of the amino acids are incompatible with the ligand properties), or their combination.
The geometric obstacles can be detected by using an algorithm for tunnel computation in molecular dynamics (e.g., CAVER~\cite{Chovancova2012} or MOLE~\cite{Sehnal2013}).
These tools are able to produce the information about time evolution of individual tunnels and for each tunnel detect its bottleneck -- the narrowest part limiting the size of the ligand aiming to pass through this tunnel.
Figure~\ref{fig:tunnel} shows an example of small ligand passing through a tunnel computed by CAVER algorithm and visualized using CAVER Analyst~\cite{Kozlikova2014}. 
The tunnel is colored with respect to the hydrophobicity of the surrounding amino acids and the geometric bottleneck of the tunnel is clearly visible.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/tunnel.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:tunnel} Small ligand (green) passing through a tunnel represented by the transparent surface. The surface encloses the available empty space along the tunnel centerline and is colored with respect to the hydrophobicity of the surrounding amino acids (hydrophobic -- red, hydrophylic -- blue, neutral -- violet). The active site is located in the left ending of the tunnel.}
\end{figure}

However, this bottleneck can be to some extent influenced by the passing ligand and this influence is also determined by the physico-chemical properties of the ligand and the bottleneck-lining amino acids (e.g., hydrophobicity or partial charges of individual atoms).
To reveal such dependencies, it requires the involvement and experience of the domain expert who has to study the ligand trajectory captured in the molecular dynamics simulation.
And for such task a proper visual representation and guidance through such large data is substantial.

In protein engineering, all these effort can finally lead to the detection of amino acids along the ligand trajectory which caused problems, i.e., were the key players in situations when the ligand gets stuck.
Such amino acids are then the best candidates for subsequent mutation of the protein chain when these amino acids are replaced by more suitable ones wrt. their size and properties.
On the other hand, in drug design the aim is to propose modifications of the ligand to increase the binding likelihood in order to design a better drug produced from this ligand.

The input data is obtained from the simulations of molecular dynamics which contains the movements of the protein and one or more ligands.
Ligands can follow two main routes -- they can be transported from the outside environment to the protein active site or vice versa (after the desired reaction the product leaves the protein).

The length of the simulations may vary from few hundreds to hundreds of thousands of time steps.  
This depends namely on the ligand velocity and its ability to find the proper path to the active site.
Figure \ref{fig:lig_movement} shows an example of a ligand trajectory consisting of $50.000$ time steps. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{img/lig_movement.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:lig_movement} Ligand trajectory (gray) for a simulation containing $50.000$ time steps.}
\end{figure}

Long simulations can often contain many time steps when the ligand followed an impasse -- it tried to find the proper entrance point to the protein (tunnel gorge) or entered a wrong tunnel and had to return.
Such parts of the simulation could be of less interest so that the user should be provided with a possibility to filter them out and focus only on the interesting parts.


\section*{Method}
\subsection*{Overview + workflow - BK}

\subsection*{Temporal Tunnel - JB}
\label{Sec:TemporalTunnel}
\todo{přehodil jsem sekci, sem, bo si myslím, že ji chceme použít aj v simplifikaci ne? + minimálně bude třeba o ní vědět při definování empy space atributu}

\todo{Nevím jak začít .... chce to asi nějakou motivaci proč vůbec temporal tunnel} 

We define the temporal tunnel as a set of spheres where the number of spheres corresponds to the number of time steps in the simulation.
Additionally, each sphere defines the maximum empty space surrounding the ligand, and as the consequence also contains the ligand, in the given time step {\color{red}(see Figure~\ref{XY})}.

In order to compute such temporal tunnel we can either utilize the pre-computed information about protein tunnels (\eg using CAVER~3.0) or approximate information about the empty space surrounding the ligand. Such approximation is possible since ligand positions over time are included in the data.
The first method is more precise but computationally more expensive, while the second approach is faster but {\color{red}can be highly inaccurate} {\color{red}see Section~\ref{XYZ} for experimental comparison)}. 
Nevertheless, in both cases we need to determine a single sphere, being a part of the temporal tunnel, for each time step.
In the first case, we obtain a set of spheres defining the shape of the tunnel in each time step ({\color{red} see Section/Paper about CAVER}). Then the entire temporal tunnel is formed by the closest sphere to the ligand, which is also wide enough \todo{wide enough není zprogramováné} to fully enclose the ligand in a given time step.

In the second case, foe each time-step we firstly retrieve the 10 closest protein atoms to the ligand. Their mean position defines the center of the tunnel sphere while the radius is represented as the minimum distance from the center to the closest atom.

%The closest sphere can be find simply by measuring the distance between the center of mass of ligand and center of each sphere.  

{\color{red} Už nestíhám, ale ta druhá metoda byla popsána v předchozím článku, takže jí z tama můžeme vytáhnout - možná to ještě udělám později, zatím teda takto.}


\subsection*{Trajectory Simplification - AJ}
\input{parts/simplification}

\subsection*{Derivation of Attributes - JB}

In previous section we described the simplification of the ligand trajectory. 
On one hand, such approximation helps to easily understand the overall ligand movements. 
On the other hand, it also suppresses vast amount of details that are important for a complete understanding of the ligand movements inside protein.

In order to preserve this information and hence allow the biochemist to explore the ligand behavior in detail we evaluate various geometrical and chemico-physical attributes of the ligand trajectory on multiple levels. 
These attributes are then communicated to the user in various ways (for more details {\color{red}see Section~\ref{XYZ}}).

We arrange the attributes into a table, $T$, where each row represents a time step of the simulation data and columns represent the derived attributes. \todo{Kazdy attribut by mal dostat nejake pismenko}

Based on several discussions with domain experts, we consider the following attributes as the most significant: "stuckenss" of the ligand in one place, its distance from the active site, direction of its movement, the amount of surrounding free space, changes of surrounding amino acids and its properties, and relative movements and rotations of the ligand inside the tunnel. 
The remaining part of this section describes and rationalizes usefulness and the way the attributes are derived from the original data.    
\todo{Obrazok kde je nakresleny ligand, tunel a ilustrovane attributy by bol super!!}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Stuckness} is one of the most abstract attributes. Fortunately, it can be easily described and estimated in relative terms. 
We consider the ligand to be stuck if it oscillates around a specific place inside the protein tunnel (w.r.t. the active site). \todo{to w.r.t. musím doprogramovat - ale myslím, že to dáva smysl ne, počítat to vzheledem k AC??} 
In other words we need to evaluate the time for which the ligand remains on or close to a single spot. 
Since the original data are uniformly sampled (\eg we know exact ligand position every two femtoseconds), we can measure the distance between two subsequent time steps and thus obtain the speed of the ligand movement in that particular area. 
The higher the speed, the higher the distance it can travel and hence it is less stuck. \todo{nevím, zda stuck je to zprávné slovo}
The importance of the attribute follows from the fact that if the ligand gets stuck for some reason it will not proceed through the protein tunnel and hence it may not reach the active site quick enough for the desired reaction to happen.
Therefore the biochemists want to explore such cases in more detail in order to either evaluate the functionality of the protein or even change its properties by replacing some amino acids.


\item \textbf{Distance} of the ligand from the active site provide the biochemists with the information whether some observed behavior occurred in vicinity of the active site, the surface, or somewhere along the path. 
This can be very helpful in cases when the biochemists, for instance, want to mutate (\ie change) some amino acids along the tunnel in order to lower the "stuckness" of the ligand in that area. 
In this case it is essential to also see where exactly the unwanted behavior of ligand happens.
In order to evaluate the distance of the ligand from active site, we first extract the position of the active site in each time step. 
Here the active site is defined by a set of surrounding amino acids, which allows us to compute the position of the active site as the center of mass of these amino acids. 
Once the position of active site is computed, we evaluate its distance from the center of mass of ligand atoms.
      
\item \textbf{Direction} of the ligand movement w.r.t. the active site is another very essential attribute. 
During the molecular dynamics simulation the ligand can enter and exit the protein tunnel repeatedly. 
Therefore, biochemists are interested in distinguishing between intervals where the ligand was traveling towards the active site and where it was traveling in the opposite direction (\ie towards the outer environment). 
To compute the direction we take use of the \textbf{distance} attribute, where in addition we evaluate whether the distance gets higher in two subsequent time steps (moving toward the active site) or lower (moving towards the protein surface). 
   

\item \textbf{Amount of free space} surrounding the ligand can assist biochemists to understand values of ligand \textbf{stuckness}. 
It was described in many studies {\color{red}\eg cite some caver?} that geometrical properties (\eg width) of the protein tunnel play a crucial role when determining reactivity between proteins and ligands. 
In our case a narrow tunnel, i.e., a low width, may prevent the ligand from progressing through the tunnel, which explains cases when \textbf{stuckness} attribute is relatively high. \todo{tato veta logicky nesedi}
In order to evaluate free space surrounding the ligand we exploit the temporal tunnel (see Section~\ref{Sec:TemporalTunnel}\todo{bez cisel se neda odkazovat na sekce!!! -> treba dat priamo nazov sekcii}). 
The representation of the temporal tunnel ensures that each its sphere corresponds exactly to a single time step and the ligand lies inside this sphere. Therefore, we can adopt the sphere radius as the "amount of free space" attribute. \todo{ta poslední věta je na dvě věci, ale nenapadá mě jak jinak}

\item \textbf{Changes of amino acids and its properties} is a very important aspect of ligand trajectory evaluation.
First, the changes of amino acids can reveal those parts of the trajectory where the ligand  significantly changes its position w.r.t. the molecule itself. 
For instance, the higher number of different amino acids surrounding the ligand between two consecutive time steps means also variations inside the protein tunnel.
Moreover, whether the ligand will be able to pass through the tunnel and reach the active site, is highly depended not only on geometric properties of the tunnel but also on its physico-chemical properties (\eg hydrophobicity or electric charge).
\todo{tady to bude chtít nějak lépe napojit}These properties, determined by surrounding amino acids, can provide insight into their influence on ligand \textbf{stuckness}.
\todo{pokud by jste chtěli, je možno tu dopsat, že hydrophobicita je průměr okolí, el. charge bude normálně podle zákona o sčítání potenionálu, atd.} 

{\color{red}\item \textbf{Relative movements and rotations} of ligands není implementováno, takže se nebudu párat zatím s tím, abych to tu popisoval, když ani zatím nevím, jak to implementovat} 

\item \textbf{Straightness} \todo{Adame?}

\section*{Visual Exploration}
\todo{treba tiez popisat interakciu s kazdym view}
\subsection*{Data Views - BK + ladies}
motivation, design

3D, bar charts, scatterplot

\subsubsection*{3D View}
This view provides an overview of ligand trajectory in 3D.
However, as was shown in Figure \ref{fig:lig_movement}, the ligand trajectory contains a lot of noise, due to jittery movement of ligand.
Therefore we introduce trajectory simplification, that was described in previous chapter.
With this function, the whole trajectory can be automatically simplified to user defined level.
If the automatic simplification does not lead to satisfactory result, parts of the trajectory can be manually selected and further simplified.
The trajectory is colored according to one of the geometrical and chemico-physical attributes we have described. 

\subsubsection*{Barchart View}
The Barchart View provides closer look at the ligand movement with respect to the properties of temporal tunnel.
It consists of three parts -- Simulation Overview, The Barchart and Amino Acid Plot.

The Simulation Overview is a temporal overview of the whole simulation, that serves as a navigation for closer exploration.
It is depicted as a bar colored according to the ligand position with respect to the protein surface and active site.
We assort the ligand movement into four categories: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Outside} The ligand is moving outside of protein.
\item \textbf{Surface} The ligand is moving alongside the protein surface.
\item \textbf{Inside} The ligand is moving within the protein.
\item \textbf{Active Site} The ligand is moving in close proximity to the active site.
\end{itemize}
This enables quick filtering of irrelevant data (e.g. part of the simulation when the ligand is moving outside the protein), as well as navigation to the potentially important parts.
The navigation is done via selection of area of interest in the Overview Bar.

The time interval selected in Simulation Overview is then displayed in The Barchart as well as in Scatterplot Matrix.
By default, each bar in The Barchart represents one time step of the simulation, though if needed (e.g. if long time sequence is selected) the neighboring bars can be aggregated.
The bars are selectable, where the selected time steps are highlighted in Scatterplot Matrix as well as in 3D View.
The height of the bar is set to represent one of the geometrical and chemico-physical attributes described in previous section.
The color of selected bars corresponds to the coloring of Simulation Overview, indicating the ligand position at given time step.

The information about the surrounding acids is also very crucial when exploring the ligand bottlenecks. 
For each time step within the temporal block we compute the three closest amino acids from the ligand. 
We provide the visual representation of this list (Figure ~\ref{fig:aacids}), where each amino acid defines one line in the list. 
The line is colored with respect to a selected chemico-physical property~---~our representation supports switching between hydrophobicity, partial charges, and donors and acceptors.
The interruption in some of these lines is caused by the fact that the given amino acid is not present around the ligand in the corresponding temporal block.

  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{img/aacids.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:aacids} Representation of amino acids surrounding the temporal tunnel and their physico-chemical properties. Coloring corresponds to a selected property, the line interruption means that this amino acid was not detected around the ligand in the corresponding temporal block.}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Scatterplot Matrix}
For detailed analysis of geometrical and chemico-physical attributes of the ligand trajectory at given time steps, we propose the Scatterplot Matrix.
The axes of one scatterplot represent a pair user-selected attributes.
Each point in the scatterplot then represents the values of these attributes at one time step.
As a result the scatterplot can easily reveal trends and relationships between attributes.
Interactive manipulation with scatterplot, such as selection, zooming and change of displayed attributes provides easy way of manual data filtering. 
To eliminate the noise in the data caused by ligand jittering, we propose the Sliding Window smoothing function.
The Sliding Window function assigns to each time step averaged value of its neighborhood.
The size of the neighborhood is user regulated. 

The plots can further be stacked, forming a matrix and thus showing relationship between multiple attributes at once.
The stacked plots are also interactively interconnected and the selection in Scatterplot Matrix is interactively linked with Barchart View and 3D View.

Figure \ref{fig:scatterplot} shows Scatterplot Matrix for a sequence of $500$ time steps.

In this section we will describe one of case studies which we have performed using our novel exploration tool.
In this particular study biochemists explored molecular simulation of Haloalkane dehalogenase protein together with its ligand. 
Since the simulation consists of 50000 time steps, it would take an enormous amount of time to analyze it using only common techniques such as plain 3D animation.
In this section we will show how this can be significantly improved using our exploration tool.
After the precomputation stage the user can immediately start to explore individual views described in the previous sections.
\todo{Chcelo by to obrazok na styl comics kde by sa ukazali najdolezitejsie kroky, napr. 1) overview 2) selection 3) 3D view 4) scatterplot selections}


We start with the rough analysis of the overall behavior of the ligand using our simulation overview (see Figure~\ref{fig:case_overview}).
Utilizing this view the biochemist can immediately see that the whole simulation consist from three main (two long and one relatively short) parts where ligand was inside the protein (blue, and green colors).
These parts are divided by orange and white blocks signalizing that ligand was moving near the protein surface (orange) or even entirely left the protein (white).
 
The {\color{red}XZY} \todo{máme pro to nějaké jméno?} view suggests that in this particular simulation the ligand started in the active site, then traveled towards the protein surface and finally left the molecule.
After spending some time outside it found again its way into a protein tunnel and traveled back to the active side.
The whole process is then repeated again while this time ligand spent significantly more time outside the protein or nearby its surface and returned just for last few hunderts of timesteps. 

After the first evaluation of the overall ligand trajectory the biochemists stated that they would like to evaluate interactions between the ligand and protein in more details in two particular scenarios. 
First, they focused on the part where ligand traveled from the active site to the protein surface (see Section~\ref{sec:case1}). 
The second interesting case, according to the biochemist, is when the ligand is trying to find its way back into the protein (see Section~\ref{sec:case2}).
Exploration of these two parts of the simulation allows the biochemist to closely evaluate the influence of the protein tunnel and its properties to the ligand movements and it may help to reveal the essence of the interaction between the observed protein and given ligand.

\todo{tohle možná patří spíš do popsiu toho overview jako takového v předchozích sekcích - až to tam teda  někdo dopíše :D}In order to explore the individual parts of the simulation in more details our tool provides a brushing tool that allows to draw a rectangle over the desired part of the simulation in simulation overview and the corresponding time steps are then selected and used for further exploration.



\subsubsection{Case 1 - ligand traveling from the active site to the protein surface}
\label{sec:case1}
For the first case the biochemist selected the first part of the simulation consisting from circa 17000 time steps (see Figure~\ref{fig:case_overview} -- Case~1). 
From this point the biochemist can continue in more detailed exploration using bruising and linking technique inside other three views -- namely using the 3D, scatter plot and bar chart views (see Figure~\ref{fig:case_example1}).
Each of this view provides slightly different preview on the data and allows the biochemist to perform different operations. 

For instance, using the scatter plot set to show distance from active site over time (see Figure~\ref{fig:case_example1}--2) immediately revealed that the ligand was actually near the protein surface (represented by high peaks) few additional times during this part of the simulation.


The same behavior can be actually seen also in the simulation overview (see Figure~\ref{fig:case_overview} -- Case~1) as slim orange lines. 
But it is much more obvious in the scatter plot view.
Moreover, the scatter plot view enables also to select these time steps (or the opposite) for future exploration in much more convenient way. 

Another interesting behavior can be seen with the same setup (see Figure~\ref{fig:case_example1}--2) is that the movement of the ligand from active site (lower values -- valleys) to the surface (higher values -- peaks) and back always happens in relatively short period of time. 
{\color{red}While there is a huge part (in the middle) where the ligand is actually stuck oscillating nearby the active site.}

\end{figure}




%This allows them to closely evaluate the influence of the protein tunnel and its properties to the ligand movements. 

%Exploration of this part of the simulation may help to reveal the essential conditions needed for this particular ligand to enter the protein.



%{\color{red}Note that the biochemists can also estimate that the provided data were probably computed using Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) \todo{popsat co je SMD in RW?} simulation since the simulation starts with ligand in the active site (signalized by red color.)}
